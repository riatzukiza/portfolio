We can use A* to navigate a signal graph and set priorities. Units will prioritize work using a score that includes distance, priority, and signals.

The behavior we want is for a unit to execute work orders efficiently. If there is a priority 1 task next to several priority 2 tasks, we'd want them to move to the priority 1 task, then to execute the nearby priority 2 tasks. There will be a look ahead on actions.

Unlike in rimworld the priorities will not be done in an order. Priorities are an additional weight added to the scoring system.

When an agent completes a task, the path it took will be added to a signal field associated with the category of the task.

Categories of tasks (not in order):
- Exploration
- construction
- grow
- self care
- doctoring
- mining
- cooking
- cleaning
- combat
- hunting
- training
- research
- hauling
- rescue
- first aid
- recration
- stocking

Additionally other qualities are included in the prioritization of tasks.

For example, a hunter will account for:
- Expected calories
- Expected distance to travel
- Quarry's threat level
- Risk tolerence of hunter
- Current food stock
- hunger

A task like hunting in our game will also not be so explicitly selected.
They will prioritize targets that are explicitly targeted, and there being explicitly marked orders for certain known animals will add in to the equation.
