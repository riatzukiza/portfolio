Yesterday I got a bit hyperfixated on terrain generation and I got a bit stressed over it. I think I need to build out some other abstractions before I can meaningfully implement procedural generation techniques. I need more than just tiles, and I need an easy way to create template tile chunks and define them with in the game.

I think what Ihave for procedural generation is mostly fine for now. I need to add random food items to the game and add a hunger mechanic so the agent has a goal. The random wandering is kinda blarg.

So the problem I have in thinking about this: How does the agent decide which is the best item to look for?

I think (for now) he can just keep a list of every food item he's seen, and when he is hungry, iterate to find the closest one.
This may not be the closest one though.

I need to go back over the notes I wrote describing the game mechanics I wanted to implement. I feel like I had a solution (at least a partial one) to that problem.

Could I do A* checking at each step for *each* item and weight on the one that is currently the closest?
## A* Pseudo code
```
OPEN //the set of nodes to be evaluated
CLOSED //the set of nodes already evaluated
add the start node to OPEN

loop
current = node in OPEN with the lowest f_cost
remove current from OPEN
add current to CLOSED

if current is the target node //path has been found
return

foreach neighbour of the current node
if neighbour is not traversable or neighbour is in CLOSED
skip to the next neighbour

if new path to neighbour is shorter OR neighbour is not in OPEN
set f_cost of neighbour
set parent of neighbour to current
if neighbour is not in OPEN
add neighbour to OPEN
```
