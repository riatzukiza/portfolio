Yesterday I got a bit hyperfixated on terrain generation and I got a bit stressed over it. I think I need to build out some other abstractions before I can meaningfully implement procedural generation techniques. I need more than just tiles, and I need an easy way to create template tile chunks and define them with in the game.

I think what Ihave for procedural generation is mostly fine for now. I need to add random food items to the game and add a hunger mechanic so the agent has a goal. The random wandering is kinda blarg.

So the problem I have in thinking about this: How does the agent decide which is the best item to look for?

I think (for now) he can just keep a list of every food item he's seen, and when he is hungry, iterate to find the closest one.
This may not be the closest one though.

I need to go back over the notes I wrote describing the game mechanics I wanted to implement. I feel like I had a solution (at least a partial one) to that problem.

Could I do A* checking at each step for *each* item and weight on the one that is currently the closest?
