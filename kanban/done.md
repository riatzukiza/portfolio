# Github static website

This has to be a priority. 
People need to be able to see my work.
This requires me to have a landing page.
I need to research what is required to set up a github static website.

Turns out it's pretty easy. I renamed the repository, set up a github 
action for a static html website.

Now I need an actual website.

I think we can call this done though, we have the work flow for a static github website and it is deployed. All we have to do is keep working on everything.

Future work will be added specific to the website around the portfolio projects as needed.
