# Simulation Reset

This feature will help me make sure that I am clearing the object pools correctly and let me change settings easier with out having to restart if I want to see the simulation from the start with a new set of settings.

## Requirements
- A button that resets the simulation without refreshing the page
- The simulation is not degraded in performance from memory leaks or other artifacts leftover from the previous simulation instance.


# Documentation

Some interfaces from the object pools have doc macros attached to them automaticly generating document markdown files from the source code. It started out as a bit of a hack, this task is centered around documenting existing code using that hack. A seperate piece of work will be genreated for enhancing the document macro system.

## Requirements

- Every major system has been documented
- The documents are published and viewable on the static github website.
- Every major system has an example associated with it.
