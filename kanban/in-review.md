# Entity Inspector

# Description

In addition to a side pallette to place the entities with, I want an interface to inspect and edit existing entities and their properties.

# Work so far

I have a panel that displays all of the rocks and their properties. 

# Work remaining

- a similar panel for all entities.
- pagination
- collapsable

# Progress update 12-7-2024

I started working on a component system encapsulating interfaces for entities.

# Progress 12-7-2024

I have pagination, and the system is set up to work for any entity with "view"able components.
I have not made it collapsable.
