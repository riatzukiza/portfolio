# New

Feature ideas we may or may not do.

## Definition of Done

We've started writing about it, and it seems feasable. It is not a duplicate.

## Tasks

- Make old symbiants work
- Make old algage work
- Add a project page to the website
- Side scroller
- add game of life to portfolio
- file explorer
- chat
- Find unknown content warnings


## Rejected

Tasks we opened up that we later realized were not useful, or a duplicate of an existing task.

## Tasks

- a backend implementation of the simulation
  - Duplicate
- Components as data views
  - Redundent by entity panel, provides data view


# Accepted

Features we have decided to look into. If we think they will add value we will move on to break down. The task must be described to continue

## Definition of Done

A brief description of the task is created. We have decided the feature has value
The task must not be a duplicate or redundent.

## Tasks

- Move all kit libraries into shared
- Cull duplicate macros
- Remove duplicate code included in headers.
- Design theme for website.
- Rewrite "andy" lib in lisp
- SPIKE: can we simplify object pools? (2 hrs)
- Implemment tests for existing shared components.
- Electron client
- vector field visualization
- neural network for signal field hyerparameter adjustments
- Individual ant neural networks
