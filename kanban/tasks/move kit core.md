- [[Move all outside work into the portfolio git]]

## Requirements

- [ ] everything in the code base continues to function 
- [ ] Code has been moved from kit-js/core

## Tasks

- [ ] Move library into shared and inc (mostly inc)
- [ ] core library is a part of compiler so code does not need includes.
- [ ] [[Remove duplicate code included in headers.]] while you are at ‚è´
- [ ] [[Cull duplicate macros]] Put a dent in this, some of the dups are probably from other libraries too.
