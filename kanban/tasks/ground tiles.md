# ground tiles

The ground needs to have different characteristics at different points, and different colorings. 
Some spots need to be easier to walk on, others need to be very hard to walk on.

## Requirements

- There is a matrix of tiles that are rendered to the screen
- Tiles have variable characteristics
- Tiles correspond to more than one coordinate point (They are larger than 1x1)
