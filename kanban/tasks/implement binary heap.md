With our A* path finding almost complete, we need a more efficient priority queue data structure. We hacked the path finding together with a list, but thats gonna be a huge no go as the map space gets larger. A* does make some good assumptions but no matter what, even the straightest possible paths over a large enough distance will eventually require a large number of open nodes, which will take a long time to sort through
