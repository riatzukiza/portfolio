# Sprites

Make the game look better with some sprite [[Graphics]], we have an existing sprite implementation. It may be worth investigating different [[Graphics]] engines at this point?
I'm not sure if individually placing dots is the best way to be doing sprites. It should
work for now. We know we have cod e for 3d stuff in another repository.


## Requirements

- Create [[Sprite sheets]] for agents and rocks
- Try existing sprite system, compare speed to vertex rendering mode speed.
- If speed is unreasonable, create a [[../templates/New Task|New Task]] to look into other [[Graphics]] 
  engine solutions, or write a new shader for sprites.
