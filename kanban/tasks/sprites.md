# Sprites

Make the game look better with some sprite graphics, we have an existing sprite implementation. It may be worth investigating different graphics engines at this point?
I'm not sure if individually placing dots is the best way to be doing sprites. It should
work for now. We know we have cod e for 3d stuff in another repository.


## Requirements

- Create sprite sheets for agents and rocks
- Try existing sprite system, compare speed to vertex rendering mode speed.
- If speed is unreasonable, create a new task to look into other graphics 
  engine solutions, or write a new shader for sprites.
