# Description


In order to represent fields in an infinite world, I need an infinite datastructure. A fixed size matrix was not going to work. I've already started work and completed a tile map system to hold meta data in a sparse array implemented as a trie.

The work of this ticket is to create an abstraction to easily set up fields of vectors held in that tile map.
## Requirements

- There is an abstract tile system type for holding vector data

## Tasks 

- Implement abstract type
- Create at least one working useful example of a field using this type to demonstrated how it is intended to be used.
