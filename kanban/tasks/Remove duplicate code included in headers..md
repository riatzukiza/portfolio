# Description 

The way I wrote the kit framework ended up adding a lot of duplicate code to the top of a lot of files.

To remove these, I need to move the kit macros into the portfolio and refactor them a bit. This task can probably be consoldated into the [[kanban/tasks/Move all outside work into the portfolio git]]
