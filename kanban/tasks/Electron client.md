I had a pretty nice system for running lisp in electron I can move into this [[../project|project]]. Something I want to do is to have a distrobutable binary of [[../../docs/Pools/Dynamic/each|each]] of the portfolio projects in the github releases

## Requirements
- Entire application works from electron shell

## Tasks
- [ ] Find a working implementation of the electron sibilant shell from old projects
- [ ] Use what you can from it to run the program in electron
- [ ] add link to hosted website to download electron clients for [[../../docs/Pools/Dynamic/each|each]] of the [[../project|project]] samples.
