# Simulation Reset

This feature will help me make sure that I am clearing the object pools correctly and let me change settings easier with out having to restart if I want to see the simulation from the start with a new set of settings.

## Requirements

- A button that resets the simulation without
  refreshing the page
- The simulation is not degraded in performance
  from memory leaks or other artifacts leftover
  from the previous simulation instance.
